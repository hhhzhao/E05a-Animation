Hello, my name is Hua Zhao. In this assignment, I studied the code of animation on arcade. This assignment is explain what is each line of the code doing in the main1 and main2. Main1.py is about the ball moving by the mouse, after we click the mouse, it will change the color and the terminal will display different number. Main2.py is about the ball is moving by the key press.


# E05a-Animation

We will begin to explore keyboard and mouse control in a Python Arcade program.

When you are done, main1.py should contain the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse). Play with the code until you feel like you understand what is going on. Comment any uncommented line; feel free to ask for help!

main2.py should contain the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_keyboard.html#move-keyboard](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_keyboard.html#move-keyboard). Play with the code until you feel like you understand what is going on. Comment any uncommented line; feel free to ask for help!

For extra credit, you could create a main3.py that contains the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation](http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation). Download sprite assets for the player and coins and figure out how to make your character walk left and right.
